# FOL Version Boundaries

Last updated: 2026-03-22

This file explains how the language should be grouped into `V1`, `V2`, `V3`,
and `V4`.

It is not a task list.
It is not a parser checklist.
It is not a promise that every chapter already works.

Its purpose is to keep one distinction clear while the compiler grows:

- the book describes the intended language
- the parser may accept a large surface of that language
- the released compiler versions should promise only the semantic subset that is
  actually implemented end to end

## The main rule

FOL already has broad syntax coverage. That is good, but it is not the same as
 saying a feature is implemented.

For versioning purposes, a feature is only considered part of a version when the
 compiler can support it through the full chain that matters for that feature.

That usually means:

- the syntax is parsed
- names can be resolved
- the relevant semantic phase enforces the feature correctly
- diagnostics are explicit when the feature is used incorrectly
- the later compiler stages needed by that feature are present too

So:

- parsed is not the same thing as implemented
- resolved is not the same thing as implemented
- a future-facing chapter in the book is not automatically a `V1` commitment

This matters because FOL should be honest about what each release guarantees.

## How to read the book through versions

The book is a language-design document. It covers:

- core language syntax
- type families
- declarations
- contracts
- memory model
- concurrency
- module layout
- error handling
- sugar
- conversion

Those chapters do not all belong to the same release milestone.

Some chapters describe core language that should work in the first usable
compiler.
Some chapters describe richer semantic systems that depend on type checking and
conformance machinery.
Some chapters describe systems behavior that depends on ownership, concurrency,
foreign interfaces, packaging, linking, and backend work.

That is why the language should be grouped into four semantic releases instead
of trying to make the whole book real at once.

## What V1 means

`V1` should be the first compiler release that can take ordinary FOL source,
carry it through package loading, resolution, type checking, and lowering, and
then produce a binary for a useful, native, non-interop subset of the language.

The key idea is coherence.
`V1` does not need every ambitious feature from the book.
`V1` needs one subset that is strong enough to be real, teachable, testable,
lowerable, and buildable from source to binary.

At the current repository head, that already means more than front-end validity.
The implemented `V1` compiler chain now reaches:

- `fol-stream`
- `fol-lexer`
- `fol-parser`
- `fol-package`
- `fol-resolver`
- `fol-typecheck`
- `fol-lower`

So the remaining `V1` gap is no longer semantic truth for the supported subset.
That part exists. The remaining `V1` work is the first backend that can consume
lowered IR and continue toward a binary.

### V1 is the core language

Based on the current book, `V1` should cover the parts of FOL that behave like
the essential language core:

- lexical structure
- names and package layout
- imports and package visibility
- ordinary declarations and bindings
- functions and procedures
- ordinary control flow
- literals and basic expressions
- aliases
- records and entries
- field access and ordinary initialization
- builtin scalar types
- a practical subset of containers
- `panic` and `report`
- enough conversion and coercion rules to type-check normal code

These are the chapters and surfaces that naturally fit there:

- `100_lexical/*`
- the core parts of `200_expressions/*`
- the core parts of `400_type/*`
- `500_items/100_variables.md`
- `500_items/200_routines/*`
- `500_items/300_constructs/100_aliases.md`
- `500_items/300_constructs/200_structs.md`
- `600_modules/*`
- `650_errors/*`
- the sugar chapters whose behavior lowers cleanly into already-supported core semantics

### Why aliases belong in V1

The alias chapter is not an advanced research feature.
It is a normal way to name types, simplify signatures, and attach methods to a
named type surface.

That means aliases are part of the core language, not a later experimental
layer.

So `ali` belongs in `V1`.

### Why records and entries belong in V1

Records and entries are also core language material.

They are not just syntax niceties.
They are the ordinary way to model structured data.
Without them, the language would be missing a basic user-defined type story.

So records and entries belong in `V1`.

### What V1 should not promise

`V1` should not pretend to support features that require major semantic systems
the compiler does not yet have.

That means a `V1` compiler should reject such features explicitly instead of
letting them pass because the parser happened to accept the syntax.

## What V2 means

`V2` should be the advanced language-semantics release.

This is the point where FOL stops being only a core language and grows its more
ambitious abstraction systems.

The important thing about `V2` is that it is still primarily about language
semantics, not low-level systems interop.

### V2 is where contracts and advanced abstraction belong

The book chapters that clearly fit here are:

- `500_items/400_standards.md`
- `500_items/500_generics.md`
- much of the metaprogramming surface in `300_meta/*`
- the more advanced sugar/type interactions that need richer semantic analysis

This is where the language starts needing machinery such as:

- generic parameter checking
- constraint checking
- conformance checking
- method-set fulfillment
- contract satisfaction
- richer dispatch rules
- more advanced conversion and inference behavior

### Why standards and blueprints belong in V2

The standards chapter is not just syntax.
It describes semantic enforcement.

A standard is meaningful only if the compiler can answer questions like:

- does this type fulfill the required methods?
- does this type fulfill the required data members?
- may this value be used where the standard is expected?
- do extension surfaces and protocol/blueprint contracts actually hold?

That is already beyond basic parsing and ordinary name resolution.
It depends on a real semantic conformance system.

That means:

- protocols belong in `V2`
- blueprints belong in `V2`
- extensions in the contract sense belong in `V2`

So if a `V1` compiler sees these surfaces, it should say they are not
implemented yet rather than silently pretending the syntax alone is enough.

### Why generics belong in V2

The generics chapter is also beyond the core language.

Generic syntax by itself is not the hard part.
The hard part is semantic behavior:

- parameter binding
- specialization rules
- checking constraints
- dispatch interactions
- generic type construction
- generic method calls

That is too much to bundle into the first core-language milestone.

So generics belong in `V2`.

### Other features that naturally fit V2

Several other book surfaces look small on the page but actually imply deeper
semantic machinery.

Those should also be treated as `V2` unless later implementation proves they
really belong elsewhere:

- `any` and `union`-style semantics from `400_type/400_special.md`
- advanced method dispatch
- advanced matching and rolling behavior when it depends on richer typing
- logic-flavored data and query surfaces such as `axi` and some logical routine
  use cases
- meta-level language features that need compile-time semantic reasoning rather
  than just syntax preservation

These are still language features, but they are not the first batch.

## What V3 means

`V3` should be the systems-semantics release.

This is where the compiler stops being only a typed language compiler and starts
growing the deeper resource and runtime semantics that the language design
already points toward.

### V3 is where memory and concurrency belong

The strongest candidates from the book are:

- `800_memory/100_ownership.md`
- `800_memory/200_pointers.md`
- `900_processor/100_eventuals.md`
- `900_processor/200_corutines.md`

### Why ownership belongs in V3

Ownership is not just another type rule.
It is a resource and lifetime system.

As soon as the compiler claims ownership and borrowing work, it must answer
hard questions correctly:

- when values move
- when values are invalidated
- when borrowing is legal
- when mutable borrowing is exclusive
- when pointers and ownership interact
- when destruction is safe

That is a deep semantic layer.
It is absolutely worth doing, but it should not be mixed into the first
type-checking and lowering milestone.

So ownership and borrowing belong in `V3`.

### Why concurrency belongs in V3

Eventuals, coroutines, channels, mutex-like routine passing, and worker/task
semantics all require more than expression typing.

They require:

- runtime model decisions
- scheduling or execution model assumptions
- channel/message typing
- synchronization semantics
- error and cancellation behavior
- later lowering/runtime support

That is not `V1`, and it is not really the same problem as standards/generics
either.

So concurrency belongs in `V3`.

So memory ownership, borrowing, pointers, eventuals, coroutines, channels, and
related runtime semantics belong in `V3`.

## What V4 means

`V4` should be the interop and toolchain-boundary release.

This is where the compiler becomes a deliberate participant in foreign
toolchains rather than only a native Rust-emitting compiler.

### V4 is where foreign interop and ABI work belong

The strongest candidates already visible in the repository direction are:

- C ABI support
- Rust interop
- header import/export
- native objects and libraries
- linker-facing build metadata

### Why C ABI belongs in V4

Foreign interop crosses several compiler layers at once.

It is not only a typechecker task.
It needs:

- package/build ownership of native artifacts
- foreign declaration modeling
- ABI-safe type checking
- symbol import/export handling
- later linker/backend integration

That is why C ABI should be a `V4` feature, not something forced into the early
language milestones.

### Why Rust interop belongs in V4

Rust interop is not just "emit Rust" in reverse.

It needs:

- foreign symbol and type modeling
- backend/linker coordination with external Rust crates
- stable lowering rules for imported Rust functions and types
- a clear boundary between FOL semantics and Rust-specific ownership/ABI details

That makes Rust interop later than core `V3` systems semantics. It belongs in
`V4` together with C ABI and the rest of the foreign-toolchain boundary work.

## The boundary between syntax and promise

One of the most important consequences of this version split is how the compiler
should behave before a version is complete.

If a feature belongs to a later version, the compiler should prefer this shape:

- parse it if the syntax is already supported
- preserve enough structure for future work if useful
- reject it explicitly at the semantic phase that would otherwise imply support

In other words:

- syntax may arrive earlier than semantic implementation
- but release promises must follow semantic ownership, not parser coverage

That keeps the language honest and lets the parser stay broad without forcing
the compiler to fake support for every surface immediately.

## How sugar should be classified

The sugar chapters should not be versioned independently from the semantics they
lower into.

The right rule is:

- a sugar feature belongs to the earliest version whose underlying semantics
  fully exist

That means:

- if a sugar form is only a nicer spelling of core `V1` behavior, it belongs in `V1`
- if it depends on richer typing, matching, contracts, or inference, it likely
  belongs in `V2`
- if it depends on ownership, concurrency, or runtime systems behavior, it
  belongs in `V3`
- if it depends on foreign ABI, Rust interop, or linker/build coordination, it
  belongs in `V4`

So sugar does not get a free pass just because it looks syntactically small.

## The practical compiler roadmap implied by this file

The intended release order is:

- finish `V1` all the way through binary-producing compiler support
- then return to the `V2` language-semantics surfaces
- then move into `V3` systems-semantics work
- then move into `V4` interop and ABI work

That means the immediate path is not:

- "implement the whole book at once"

It is:

- make the core language real from front end through type checking and later
  binary-producing stages
- keep later-version features visible in the book
- reject later-version features explicitly until their real semantic owner exists

## Summary split

If the language needs only core typing and normal program semantics, it is
probably `V1`.

If the language needs conformance, generics, richer compile-time abstraction, or
advanced type semantics, it is probably `V2`.

If the language needs ownership, borrowing, pointers, concurrency/runtime
coordination, or execution-model semantics, it is probably `V3`.

If the language needs foreign interop, C ABI, Rust interop, native library
linking, or build/linker cooperation, it is probably `V4`.

That is the line this repository should keep using while the compiler grows.
