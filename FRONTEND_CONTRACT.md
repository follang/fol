# Front-End Contract

This file records the current stream, lexer, and parser contracts that the code and
tests actually enforce today.

## Lexer Stage Ownership

- `stage0`: consumes the unified character stream, preserves source locations, and
  injects only the minimum synthetic boundary and EOF markers needed for stable
  downstream tokenization.
- `stage1`: performs first-pass token classification from characters into the initial
  token families.
- `stage2`: folds and normalizes the classified token stream, including multi-character
  operators and separator cleanup.
- `stage3`: performs the final parser-facing disambiguation, especially around numeric
  literal forms and explicit EOF behavior.

## Stream Contract

### Source Ordering

- Folder traversal is deterministic.
- Directory entries are processed in lexicographic filename order.
- Regular directories are traversed recursively in that same sorted order.
- `.mod` directories are skipped before any source collection.
- The lexer now preserves that stream ordering across file boundaries instead of
  accidentally joining touching files into one token.

### Source Identity

- A stream source is identified by its canonical file path plus the package and
  namespace chosen for the current run.
- The original call site is preserved separately so file discovery mode can still
  be reported without changing logical identity.

### Package Detection

- Detached folders fall back to their own folder name as the package name.
- Detached files fall back to their parent folder name as the package name.
- Nested manifests use the nearest `Cargo.toml` package name, not the outermost one.
- Explicit package overrides intentionally change logical identity without changing
  the canonical source path.
