An import declaration states that the source file containing the declaration depends on functionality of the imported package and enables access to exported identifiers of that package.

Syntax to import a library is:
```
use package_name: mod = { path }
```

There are two type of import declartions:
- system libraries
- local libraries

## System libraries
This is how including other libraries works, for example include `fmt` module from standard library:
```
use fmt: std = {"fmt"};

pro main: ini = {
    fmt::log.warn("Last warning!...")
}
```
To use only the `log` namespace of `fmt` module:
```
use log: std = {"fmt/log"};

pro[] main: int = {
    log.warn("Last warning!...")
}
```
But let's say you only wanna use ONLY the `warn` functionality of `log` namespace from `fmt` module:
```
use warn std = {"fmt/log.warn"};

pro[] main: int = {
    warn("Last warning!...")
}
```
## Local libraries
To include a local package (example, package name `bender`), then we include the folder where it is, followed by the package name (folder is where files are located, package is the name defned with mod[])

```
use bend: loc = {"../folder/bender"};
```
Then to acces only a namespace:
```
use space: loc = {"../folder/bender/space"};
```

## URL libraries
Libraries can be directly URL imported:

```
use space: url = {"https://github.com/follang/std"};
```
