# Declarations

Each `.fol` file inside a folder is part of the same package.

The important part is that files are **connected, but not merged**:

- every physical `.fol` file is still its own source file
- files in the same folder share one package scope
- declarations are order independent across those files
- a declaration started in one file can **not** continue into the next file

There is no need to import sibling files from the same package. They already belong to the same package scope.

## Package, Namespace, And File Scope

It helps to think about source layout in three layers:

- **package scope**: all `.fol` files directly inside the package folder
- **namespace scope**: declarations inside subfolders of that package
- **file scope**: declarations marked `hid`, which stay visible only inside their own file

In short:

- same folder = same package
- subfolder = nested namespace
- `hid` = file only
- files are never imported directly as standalone modules

### Package scope

Files that live directly in the package root share one package scope:

```
root/
    math/
        add.fol
        sub.fol
```

Both `add.fol` and `sub.fol` belong to package `math`, so declarations from one file may be used by the other without importing the sibling file.

### Namespace scope

Subfolders do not create a new package by themselves. They create nested namespaces inside the same package:

```
root/
    math/
        add.fol
        stats/
            mean.fol
```

Here:

- `add.fol` is in package namespace `math`
- `mean.fol` is in package namespace `math::stats`

Code may reach namespace members either by:

- direct `use`
- or qualified access with `::`

### File scope

Sometimes a declaration should stay inside one file even though the package is shared.
That is what `hid` is for.

```
// file1.fol
var[hid] cache_key: str = "local"
```

```
// file2.fol
pro[] main: int = {
    .echo(cache_key)      // error: hidden declarations are file-only
}
```

## Namespaces

A namespace can be defined in a subfolder of the main folder, and namespaces can be nested.

To acces the namespace there are two ways:
- direct import with `use`
- or code access with `::`

### Direct import

```
use aNS: loc = {""home/folder/printing/logg""}

pro[] main: int = {
    logg.warn("something")
}

```
### Code access

```
use aNS: loc = {""home/folder/printing""}

pro[] main: int = {
    printing::logg.warn("something")
}

```

## Mental model

For source layout, the mental model is:

- one folder root gives one package
- each file in that folder is a real source file in that package
- subfolders extend the namespace path
- `use` imports packages or namespaces
- `hid` keeps a declaration private to one file
- `loc` imports a local directory tree without a package control file
- `std` imports a toolchain-owned directory tree
- `pkg` imports a formal external package defined by `build.fol`

This means FOL is **not** "one file = one module".
The package is the folder; the file is a source unit inside that package.

## Package Roots

When a directory is treated as a package root, the exact contract depends on the import kind:

- `loc`: plain local directory import, no package metadata required
- `loc`: plain local directory import, no package control file required
- `std`: toolchain standard-library directory import
- `pkg`: installed external package import with explicit root files

For `pkg`, the root is not just "a folder containing `.fol` files".
It is a formal package root with:

- `build.fol` as the package control file

This keeps the language model clean:

- source files `use` other namespaces/packages
- package build execution starts from `pro[] build(): non` in `build.fol`
- package metadata and direct dependencies are configured through `.build()` inside `build.fol`
- package loading happens before ordinary name resolution

`build.fol` itself is still ordinary FOL syntax.
It is not a separate mini-language.
The package layer simply gives package/build meaning to the canonical build
routine there.

## Blocks

Block statement is used for scopes where members get destroyed when scope is finished. And there are two ways to define a block: 
- unnamed blocks and 
- named blocks

### Unnamed blocks
Are simply scopes, that may or may not return value, and are represented as: `{ //block }`, with `.` before the brackets for return types and `_` for non return types:
```
pro[] main: int = {
    _{
        .echo("simple type block")
    }
    .echo(.{ return "return type block" })
}
```

### Named blocks
Blocks can be used as labels too, when we want to unconditionally jump to a specific part of the code.
```
pro[] main: int = {
    def block: blk[] = {            // $block A named block that can be referenced
        // implementation
    }
    def mark: blk[]                 // $mark A named block that can be referenced, usually for "jump" statements
}
```
