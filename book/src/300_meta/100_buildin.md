# Intrinsics

Intrinsics are compiler-owned language operations.

They are not ordinary library functions, and they are not imported through
`use`.

FOL currently keeps three layers separate:

- intrinsics:
  compiler-owned operations such as `.eq(...)`, `.len(...)`, `check(...)`, and
  `panic(...)`
- `core`:
  the minimal runtime model with no heap and no OS/runtime services
- `alloc`:
  heap-backed library/runtime support without OS/runtime services
- `std`:
  hosted/runtime services on top of `alloc`, such as console, filesystem,
  networking, serialization, and other richer services

This split is not a source-level import trick and not an object-system feature.
It is an artifact runtime model selected through `build.fol`.

If an operation can live as an ordinary library API, that is usually the better
home for it. Intrinsics are reserved for surfaces the compiler must understand
directly.

## Surfaces

The current compiler recognizes three intrinsic surfaces.

## Dot-root calls

These are written with a leading dot:

```fol
.eq(a, b)
.not(flag)
.len(items)
.echo(value)
```

Dot-root intrinsics are the main current intrinsic family.

## Keyword calls

These look like language keywords rather than dot calls:

```fol
check(read_code(path))
panic("unreachable state")
```

The current `V1` compiler treats `check` and `panic` as intrinsics too, even
though they are not written with `.`.

## Operator aliases

Some future intrinsic surfaces are written like operators:

```fol
value as target_type
value cast target_type
```

These are registry-owned now, but they are not implemented in the current `V1`
compiler.

## Current `V1` implemented intrinsics

The current compiler implements this subset end to end through type checking and
lowering.

For current `V1`, backend execution of the implemented intrinsic set still goes
through the current runtime layer where policy matters. The runtime contract is
being split by `fol-model`, so the rule is:

- `core` artifacts must not rely on heap-backed or hosted facilities
- `alloc` artifacts may use heap-backed facilities but not hosted services
- `std` artifacts may use hosted services

In the current implementation that means:

- `.len(...)` uses the runtime length helper
- `.echo(...)` uses the runtime echo hook and formatting contract
- `check(...)` uses the runtime recoverable-result inspection contract
- scalar comparisons and `.not(...)` may lower to native target operations

### Comparison

```fol
.eq(left, right)
.nq(left, right)
.lt(left, right)
.gt(left, right)
.ge(left, right)
.le(left, right)
```

Current `V1` rule:

- `.eq(...)` and `.nq(...)` work on comparable scalar pairs
- `.lt(...)`, `.gt(...)`, `.ge(...)`, and `.le(...)` work on ordered scalar
  pairs

If you call them with the wrong number of arguments or with unsupported type
families, the compiler reports an intrinsic-specific type error.

### Boolean

```fol
.not(flag)
```

Current `V1` rule:

- `.not(...)` accepts exactly one `bol`

### Query

```fol
.len(items)
```

Current `V1` rule:

- `.len(...)` accepts exactly one operand
- the operand must currently be one of:
  - `str`
  - `arr[...]`
  - `vec[...]`
  - `seq[...]`
  - `set[...]`
  - `map[...]`

In the current compiler, `.len(...)` is the only implemented query intrinsic.
Under the runtime model split, array `.len(...)` belongs to `core`, while
string and dynamic-container `.len(...)` belongs to `alloc`/`std`.

### Diagnostic

```fol
.echo(value)
```

Current `V1` rule:

- `.echo(...)` accepts exactly one argument
- it emits the value through the current hosted runtime hook
- it then forwards the same value unchanged

`.echo(...)` belongs to `std`, not `core` or `alloc`.

So this is valid:

```fol
fun[] main(flag: bol): bol = {
    return .echo(flag)
}
```

### Recoverable and control intrinsics

```fol
check(read_code(path))
panic("fatal")
```

Current `V1` rule:

- `check(expr)` asks whether a recoverable routine call failed and returns `bol`
- `panic(...)` aborts control flow immediately

These are described in more detail in the recoverable-error chapter.

## Current `V1` deferred intrinsics

The registry already reserves more names than the compiler implements.

That does **not** mean they work today.

### Reserved but deferred for likely `V1.x`

- `as`
- `cast`
- `assert`
- `.cap(...)`
- `.is_empty(...)`
- `.low(...)`
- `.high(...)`

These are recognized as registry-owned language surfaces, but the current
compiler rejects them with explicit milestone-boundary diagnostics.

### Reserved for later `V2`

- bitwise helpers such as `.bit_and(...)`, `.bit_or(...)`, `.shl(...)`,
  `.shr(...)`, `.rotl(...)`, `.rotr(...)`, `.pop_count(...)`, `.clz(...)`,
  `.ctz(...)`, `.byte_swap(...)`, `.bit_reverse(...)`
- overflow-mode helpers such as `.checked_add(...)`, `.wrapping_add(...)`,
  `.saturating_add(...)`, `.overflowing_add(...)`, and their subtraction forms

These are intentionally reserved now so the language can grow without
accidental user-space name collisions, but they are not part of the current
`V1` compiler.

### Reserved for later `V3`

- `.de_alloc(...)`
- `.give_back(...)`
- `.address_of(...)`
- `.pointer_value(...)`
- `.borrow_from(...)`

These depend on later ownership, pointer, and low-level systems semantics.

## Library-preferred surfaces

Some names are kept in the registry roadmap only as placeholders while the
language decides whether they should really stay compiler-owned.

Current examples:

- `.add(...)`
- `.sub(...)`
- `.mul(...)`
- `.div(...)`
- `.abs(...)`
- `.min(...)`
- `.max(...)`
- `.clamp(...)`
- `.floor(...)`
- `.ceil(...)`
- `.round(...)`
- `.trunc(...)`
- `.pow(...)`
- `.sqrt(...)`

The current direction is that many of these may fit better in `core` or `std`
instead of becoming permanent compiler intrinsics.

## Intrinsics are not shell operations

Do not confuse intrinsics with shell syntax such as `nil` and postfix unwrap
`!`.

For example:

```fol
ali MaybeText: opt[str]
ali Failure: err[str]

fun[] unwrap_optional(value: MaybeText): str = {
    return value!
}

fun[] unwrap_failure(value: Failure): str = {
    return value!
}
```

That `!` surface is part of shell typing, not the intrinsic registry.

Likewise, recoverable routine calls such as:

```fol
fun[] read_code(path: str): int / str = { ... }
```

are handled with:

- `check(expr)`
- `expr || fallback`

not with shell unwrap.

## Current compiler truth

The current compiler has one shared intrinsic registry crate:

`fol-intrinsics`

That registry is the source of truth for:

- canonical intrinsic names and aliases
- milestone availability (`V1` / `V2` / `V3`)
- type-checking selection rules
- lowering mode
- backend/runtime role classification

The current runtime companion for implemented `V1` intrinsics is:

`fol-runtime`

- intrinsic names
- aliases
- categories
- current milestone availability
- deferred-roadmap classification
- lowering mode
- backend-facing role

So the short rule is:

- parser recognizes intrinsic syntax
- `fol-intrinsics` owns intrinsic identity
- type checking validates intrinsic calls
- lowering maps them to explicit IR shapes

This page should describe only the subset that is actually implemented, plus
clearly marked deferred surfaces.
