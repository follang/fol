Fol has many build-in functions and macros offered by compiler, and you access them by . (with space/newline/bracket before):

```
var contPoint: ptr[int] = 10;			// make a pointer and asign the memory to value of 10
.print(.pointer_value(contPoint));		// print the dereferenced value of pointer
```
