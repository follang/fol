# Editor Tooling

FOL editor support lives in one crate:

- `fol-editor`

That crate owns two related subsystems:

- Tree-sitter assets for syntax-oriented editor work
- the language server for compiler-backed editor services

## Public Entry

The public entrypoints are exposed through `fol tool`:

- `fol tool lsp`
- `fol tool parse <PATH>`
- `fol tool highlight <PATH>`
- `fol tool symbols <PATH>`
- `fol tool references <PATH> --line <LINE> --character <CHARACTER>`
- `fol tool rename <PATH> --line <LINE> --character <CHARACTER> <NEW_NAME>`
- `fol tool semantic-tokens <PATH>`
- `fol tool tree generate <PATH>`

This keeps editor workflows under the same `fol` binary rather than introducing
a second public tool.

## Split Of Responsibilities

Tree-sitter is the editor syntax layer.

It is responsible for:

- syntax trees while typing
- query-driven highlighting
- locals and symbol-style structure captures
- editor-facing structural parsing

The language server is the semantic editor layer.

It is responsible for:

- JSON-RPC/LSP transport
- open-document state
- compiler-backed diagnostics
- hover
- go-to-definition
- references
- rename for same-file local symbols
- semantic tokens
- document symbols
- completion

The currently supported v1 LSP surface is:

- diagnostics
- hover
- definition
- references
- rename for same-file local symbols
- semantic tokens
- document symbols
- completion

The server keeps one semantic snapshot per open document version. It reuses
that snapshot for hover, definition, references, rename, semantic tokens,
document symbols, and completion until the document changes or closes.

## Compiler Truth

`fol-editor` does not create a second semantic engine.

Semantic truth still comes from:

- `fol-package`
- `fol-resolver`
- `fol-typecheck`
- `fol-diagnostics`

So the model is:

- Tree-sitter answers “what does this text structurally look like?”
- compiler crates answer “what does this code mean?”

For the current maintenance contract between compiler crates, LSP behavior, and
Tree-sitter assets, see:

- [Compiler Integration](./350_compiler_integration.md)
- [Feature Update Checklist](./450_feature_checklist.md)

## Current Practical Workflow

Use:

```text
fol tool lsp
```

as the language server entrypoint.

Launch it from inside a discovered package or workspace root. The frontend
looks upward for `package.yaml` or `fol.work.yaml` before starting the server.

Use:

```text
fol tool parse path/to/file.fol
fol tool highlight path/to/file.fol
fol tool symbols path/to/file.fol
fol tool references path/to/file.fol --line 12 --character 8
fol tool rename path/to/file.fol --line 12 --character 8 total
fol tool semantic-tokens path/to/file.fol
```

for parser/query debugging and validation.
