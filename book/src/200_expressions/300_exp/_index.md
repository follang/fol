# Expressions

An expression is a sequence of operators and their operands, that specifies a computation. It is a sequence of one or more operands and zero or more operators that can be evaluated to a single value, object, routine, or namespace. Expressions can consist of a literal value, a routine invocation, an operator and its operands, or a simple name. Simple names can be the name of a variable, type member, routine parameter, namespace or type.

Expressions can use operators that in turn use other expressions as parameters, or routine calls whose parameters are in turn other routine calls, so expressions can range from simple to very complex.

Types of expressions are divided into two groups:
- calculations
- literals
- ranges
- access
