Ordinal types

Ordinal types have the following characteristics:

- Ordinal types are countable and ordered. This property allows the operation of functions as inc, ord, dec on ordinal types to be defined.
- Ordinal values have a smallest possible value. Trying to count further down than the smallest value gives a checked runtime or static error.
- Ordinal values have a largest possible value. Trying to count further than the largest value gives a checked runtime or static error.


Ordinal types are the most primitive type of data:

- Intigers: `int[options]`
- Floating: `flt[options]`
- Characters: `chr[options]`
- Booleans: `bol`

### Intiger type
An integer is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer of the u32 type, the type declaration indicates that the value itâ€™s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with i, instead of u) that takes up 32 bits of space: 
```
var aVar: int[u32] = 45;
```
Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed and unsigned refer to whether itâ€™s possible for the number to be negative or positiveâ€”in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned). Itâ€™s like writing numbers on paper: when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however, when itâ€™s safe to assume the number is positive, itâ€™s shown with no sign.
```
Length  |   Signed  | Unsigned  |
-----------------------------------
8-bit   |   8       |   u8      |
16-bit  |   16      |	u16     |
32-bit	|   32      |	u32     |
64-bit	|   64	    |   u64     |
128-bit	|   128     |	u128    |
arch	|   arch    |	uarch   |
```

### Float type
Fol also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Folâ€™s floating-point types are `flt[32]` and `flt[64]`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `flt[64]` because on modern CPUs itâ€™s roughly the same speed as `flt[32]` but is capable of more precision. 
```
Length  |    Type  |
--------------------
32-bit	|   32     |
64-bit	|   64     |
arch	|   arch   |
```
Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The `flt[32]` type is a single-precision float, and `flt[f64]` has double precision.

```
pro[] main: int = {
    var aVar: flt = 2.;                         // float 64 bit
    var bVar: flt[64] = .3;                     // float 64 bit
    .assert(.sizeof(aVar) == .sizeof(bVar))     // this will true

    var bVar: flt[32] = .54;                    // float 32 bit
}
```
### Character type
In The Unicode Standard 8.0, Section 4.5 "General Category" defines a set of character categories. Fol treats all characters in any of the letter as Unicode letters, and those in the Number category as Unicode digits. 
```
chr[utf8,utf16,utf32]
```

```
def testChars: tst["some testing on chars"] = {
    var bytes = "hello";
    .assert(.typeof(bytes) == *var [5:0]u8);
    .assert(bytes.len == 5);
    .assert(bytes[1] == "e");
    .assert(bytes[5] == 0);
    .assert("e" == "\x65");
    .assert("\u{1f4a9}" == 128169);
    .assert("ðŸ’¯" == 128175);
    .assert(.mem.eql(u8, "hello", "h\x65llo"));
}
```
### Boolean type
The boolean type is named `bol` in Fol and can be one of the two pre-defined values `true` and `false`. 
```
bol
```
