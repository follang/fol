# Constructs

A construct is a collection of fields, possibly of different data types, typically in fixed number and sequence. It is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. The fields of a construct may also be called members. 

Constructs come in two forms: 
- alias declarations (aliases) and 
- type definitions (structs)
