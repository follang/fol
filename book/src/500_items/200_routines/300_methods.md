# Methods

A method is a routine associated with a receiver type. In FOL, methods can be
declared as either `fun` or `pro` and called with dot syntax
(`value.method(...)`).

Methods in FOL are procedural sugar, not object-oriented behavior.

A method call is just sugar for calling a routine whose first explicit input is
the receiver value. In other words:

```fol
tool.parse_msg(10)
```

should be read as the procedural call:

```fol
parse_msg(tool, 10)
```

This syntax does not introduce:

- classes
- inheritance
- object-owned method bodies
- object-method dispatch as a separate runtime model

`typ` declares data. Receiver-qualified routines are still ordinary routines.

Current parser-supported receiver declaration syntax is:

```fol
fun (parser)parse_msg(code: int): str = {
    return "ok";
}

pro (parser)update(code: int): int = {
    return code;
}
```

The receiver type appears in parentheses right after `fun` or `pro`, followed by the method name.

That receiver clause does not move the routine "inside" the type. It only says
which type may be used in dot-call form for that routine.

The current parser accepts a broader receiver syntax than the final V1
semantic subset. At parse time, receiver positions can still accept named,
qualified, builtin-scalar, and bracketed/composite type references. That is a
parser fact, not an object model.

The dedicated parser-level rejection in this hardening phase is still for special
builtin forms such as `any`, `none`, and `non`.

Invalid example:

```fol
fun (any)parse_msg(code: int): str = {
    return "ok";
}
```

This form reports: `Method receiver type cannot be any, non, or none`.

Method calls use standard dot syntax:

```fol
var tool: parser = parser.new()
var msg: str = tool.parse_msg(10)
```

This is equivalent in meaning to passing `tool` as the first routine argument.
The dot form is only the call-site spelling.

For record-focused V1 code, the intended reading is:

- records hold data
- routines stay separate
- the receiver clause only enables `value.method(...)` spelling

Custom error routines also support reporting method call results when receiver-qualified signatures are available:

```fol
fun (parser)parse_err(code: int): str = {
    return "bad-input";
}

fun run(tool: parser, code: int): int / str = {
    report tool.parse_err(code)
    return 0
}
```
