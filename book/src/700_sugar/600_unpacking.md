# Unpacking

Unpacking—also known as iterable destructuring—is another form of pattern matching used to extract data from collections of data. Take a look at the following example:
```
var start, *_ = { 1, 4, 3, 8 }
.echo(start)                                // Prints 1
.echo(_)                                    // Prints [4, 3, 8]
```

In this example, we’re able to extract the first element of the list and ignore the rest. Likewise, we can just as easily extract the last element of the list:
```
var *_, end = { "red", "blue", "green" }
.echo(end)                                  // Prints "green"
```

In fact, with pattern matching, we can extract whatever we want from a data set assuming we know it’s structure:
```
var start, *_, (last_word_first_letter, *_) = { "Hi", "How", "are", "you?" }
.echo(last_word_first_letter)               // Prints "y"
.echo(start)                                // Prints "Hi"
```

Now, that has to be one of the coolest programming language features. Instead of extracting data by hand using indices, we can just write a pattern to match which values we want to unpack or destructure.
